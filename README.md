* Description 

In this program a random password generator was created. as a programer we were instructed to create the script.js of the application so that the actual random password could be generated. This included asking the user many different questions and criteria such as the length of the password the user wants and the characters included. The random password is required to be between 8 and 128 characters and must select if they want lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters to be included.
